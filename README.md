# Practicing Input and Output

This assignment will have you practice receiving text input from a user and producing text output to the Python command line.

## Details

This project includes some starter code as well as some tests that will help you determine whether you have written the solution code correctly or not.

### Starter code files

There are two starter code files:

- **practice_input.py**
- **practice_output.py**

And one program that, when run, will run all the code in both those `practice_` files.

- **main.py**

### Filling in the functions

Both `practice_` files have some pre-defined functions. Each function has instructions for what code to write and place within it.

In order to properly place code within a function, the code within the function must be indented underneath the function definition.

For example, take this function starter code in the file, `practice_output.py`:

```python
def print_with_line_break():
  """
  Prints out the text, 'Hello world!' with a line break at the end
  """
  # write your code here
```

The code to solve this problem must be indented below the function definition, such as:

```python
def print_with_line_break():
  """
  Prints out the text, 'Hello world!' with a line break at the end
  """
  # write your code here
  print("Hello world!")
```

Note that the `print("Hello world!")` line is indented the same as the line above it, which is one tab to the right of the line that says, `def print_with_line_break():`. Keep this indentation.

### Running your programs

If you run the `practice_` files directly, they will not actually do anything... none of the functions in those files are run, by default.

Run the given `main.py` file in order to run all the functions in the other two files.

If you want to only one run function at a time, comment out the calls to the other functions that you don't want to run. Python comments are lines that have the `#` in front of them - this disables those lines and prevents the interpreter from running them.

For example, if you only want to run the `print_with_line_break()` function from the `practice_output.py` file, your main function in `main.py` should look like this:

```python
def main():
  """
  Calls each of the functions in the practice_output and practice_input files
  """

  # call each function defined in practice_output
  practice_output.print_with_line_break()
  # practice_output.print_without_line_break()
  # practice_output.print_with_separator_dash_and_with_line_break()
  # practice_output.print_with_separator_dash_and_without_line_break()

  # call each function defined in practice_input
  # practice_input.get_favorite_vegetable()
  # practice_input.get_favorite_number()
  # practice_input.get_name_and_zodiac_sign()
  # practice_input.get_name_and_age()
```

### Testing your work

Included in the given code are some tests, using the **pytest** testing framework. These tests should all pass if the code in each function is done correctly.

If the tests do not appear, or seem to never stop loading, open up a Terminal window and run the command, `pytest --collect-only`, to see whether there are any errors in the code that prevent the tests from being discovered.
